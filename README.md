# Hotel Scraper And Analysis

As part of a research I am doing at the college, I need to go into the various hotel sites, extract data from them and analyze them.

The general idea of the study is to estimate the prices of hotels according to different regions and hotel names.
Another advantage of the success of predicting hotel prices is the ability to lower costs to the various search sites that offer hotel search services.

This is because the various hotel websites use the hotel search services to provide service to those customers who are looking for hotels, and the cost of such search costs money for the same site that provides hotel search services.
On the other hand, if those sites had the ability to predict a certain percentage of success in hotel prices, they would not have to make immediate use of the databases of those hotels, but rather use forecasting, a kind of "smart grid".
And only when the customer was certain that he was interested in purchasing a hotel reservation would the site perform a secondary search at the same hotel.
In fact, the idea is not to always use the database of hotel sites, but only if the user really wants to buy, thus saving significant costs of money on the service and use of the same databases provided by hotel sites.
